<h3>AlgoComp is React web application to visualize and compare search algorithms :detective:</h3>

## About
Learning or understanding the pathfinding or search algorithms and comparing them both theoretically and practically just by observing the examples or practicing its code becomes a complex task. It not only becomes confusing but also difficult to understand and as a result boring. Instead, visualizing it in real-time or with the help of animations we can make this complex process not only easy but also a comparatively simpler and a better approach for understanding. <b>This is the inspiration behind the development of this app.</b>

## Features of this Project!

* Graph of obstacles with option to select any node as Start and Finish node.
* Different path finding algorithms like Dijkshtra, BFS, DFS, A*.
* Different Maze algorithms to generate ready grid like Recursive Division, Horizontal & Vertical Division, etc.
* Comparison of all algorithms individually in terms of runtime of algorithm, cost of path, no. of nodes visited, visualization time.
* Comparison of all algorithms simultaneously in terms of final path of algorihtms by different colors.
* Handling of Edge Cases.
